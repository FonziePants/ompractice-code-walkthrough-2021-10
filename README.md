# Ompractice Code Walkthrough (October 2021)
This is the code sample that will be used for the technical screen when **code walkthrough** is selected as the interviewee's preference.

## Why are you offering this option?
We want to gauge your problem-solving and software engineering skills, and at the same time, we recognize that even great engineers don't always excel at white-boarding interviews. Because we want you to show off your skills and algorithmic-thinking in your best light, we offer a handful of interviewing options for the technical screen portion of the interview process, including a **code walkthrough**. 

## What happens during the code walkthrough?
We will ask you to open this code sample on your own computer and, while screen-sharing, walk through what it does. As you explain what the code is doing, you may be asked clarifying questions, such as:

- What is happening on specific lines of code?
- What is being rendered on the screen?
- If you were given the chance to refactor this code, what would you change and why?
- If you were asked to change the functionality in specific ways, how might you approach doing so? What would you need to change?

The discussion will be interactive and we will be assessing for your comprehension of the technologies and your thoughtfulness around possible improvements. If you have any follow-up questions on the code sample or expected data inputs, please do not hesitate to ask during the interview.

## How long should this take?
This should take somewhere between 15 and 40 minutes out of the 60-minute technical screen.

## How do I build this code? Where is the rest of the project?
This code sample (a React component) is designed to be largely standalone so that you shouldn't need to build it as part of a project to understand what it does. We do **not** expect you to try and build and test this sample code before the interview.

## Why is the code so messy and/or buggy?
The goal of this code walkthrough is not just to understand how effectively the interviewee can read and comprehend code -- it is also to understand how the interviewee thinks about various aspects of software development, including performance, readability, maintainability, and accessibility. Accordingly, this code sample was designed to have plenty of room for improvement. During the interview, please do not hesitate to point out bugs and offer suggestions on how the code could be improved.
